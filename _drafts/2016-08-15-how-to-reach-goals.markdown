Don't hurry and don't try to reach you goal today, tomorrow or even through a week. Depending on situation it can be a very long term process. You should build you final goal every day by some small bricks.

Most important thing, that if in some moment you are feeling very frustrating, some things give you very hard and you think that it would be better to throw all away, KEEP GOING, don't stop, it is sign that soon you will get a level up. I convinced that very often in my life.

Eliminate all negative emotions from your life. Try almost don't think about them. When negative emotions come to you, just throw them away.

Try to don't think negative about every human. Even he is very bad.

Don't dream and think about your result. You should enjoy and receive positive emotions from work process, but not from result.
